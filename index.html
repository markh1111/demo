      <p>
        You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset<br />
        She's going off about something that you said<br />
        'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do<br />
        I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night<br />
        I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like<br />
        And she'll never know your story like I do<br />
        But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts<br />
        She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers<br />
        Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br />
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br />
        If you could see that I'm the one who understands you<br />
        Been here all along, so why can't you see?<br />
        You belong with me, you belong with me<br />
        Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans<br />
        I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be<br />
        Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself<br />
        "Hey, isn't this easy?"<br />
        And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town<br />
        I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down<br />
        You say you're fine, I know you better than that<br />
        Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?<br />
        She wears high heels, I wear sneakers<br />
        She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers<br />
        Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br />
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br />
        If you could see that I'm the one who understands you<br />
        Been here all along, so why can't you see?<br />
        You belong with me<br />
        Standing by and waiting at your backdoor<br />
        All this time how could you not know, baby?<br />
        You belong with me, you belong with me<br />
        Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night<br />
        I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry<br />
        I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams<br />
        Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me<br />
        Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?<br />
        Been here all along, so why can't you see?<br />
        You belong with me<br />
        Standing by and waiting at your backdoor<br />
        All this time how could you not know, baby?<br />
        You belong with me, you belong with me<br />
        You belong with me<br />
        Have you ever thought, just maybe<br />
        You belong with me?<br />
        You belong with me<br />
